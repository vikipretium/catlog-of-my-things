# Catalog of Things

> In this project, we created a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything is be based on the UML class diagram presented. The data will be stored in JSON files but we also prepared a database with tables structure analogical to the program's class structure.
